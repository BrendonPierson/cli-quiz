			<h2>My Sister’s Funeral
			Gerald Stern, 1925</h2>
			<p>	
			<span class="highlight">Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it 
			all alone</span>, which made the two of us closer
			though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would
			have been better I think sometimes to be sterile
			from the start just to avoid the pain 
			which in my life this far has lasted seventy
			years for I am in love with a skeleton
			on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,
			on whose small skull a bit of curly hair
			was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know
			since there was no mother to turn to then and ask
			what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,
			and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it
			true somebody said the other peach
			should have died instead of her; and I could 
			imagine the nose going first though forty years later
			the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;
			and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips
			who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,
			a flabby body, half the house was filled with 
			male cousins, they were born in rooms a 
			short distance from the rats, I can’t remember
			which ones had the accents nor what his
			Hebrew name was, nor his English.

			<h2>Sonnet [Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,]
			Karen Volkman</h2>
			<p>
			 Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,
			the earth, blue egg, <span class="highlight">in its seeping shell
			dispensing damage like a hollow hell</span>
			inchling weeping for a minor sea

			ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.
			The blue beneficence we call and spell
			and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well
			of constant water, deepening a thee,

			a thou and who, touching every what—
			and in the or, a shudder in the cut—
			and that you are, blue mirror, only stare

			bluest blankness, whether in the where,
			sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught
			drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.
